# CSES Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/). 

## Repository Structure

The problems are organized by their respective categories as listed on CSES:

```
├── Sorting and Searching
├── Dynamic Programming
├── Graph Algorithms
├── Range Queries
├── Tree Algorithms
├── Mathematics
├── String Algorithms
└── Other
```

Within each folder, you'll find the problem's solution file named as per the problem title .

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saumik-talukdar/CSES
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Category Folder**:
   Each problem is grouped under its category folder (e.g., `Sorting and Searching`, `Dynamic Programming`, etc.).

3. **View Solutions**:
   The solutions are written in C++ and use a standard competitive programming template. You can open the solution files directly to view or copy the code.

4. **Run the Code**:
   If you want to run the code locally, use any C++ compiler, such as `g++`. Example:
   ```
   g++ -std=c++17 sorting_and_searching/restaurant_customers.cpp -o restaurant_customers
   ./restaurant_customers
   ```
